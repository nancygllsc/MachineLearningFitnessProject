# MachineLearningFitnessProject
 This project is to predict the manner in which individuals performed a specific exercise
Project Objective
The primary aim of this project is to predict how individuals performed a specific exercise, as represented by the "classe" variable in the training dataset. You can utilize any other available variables to aid in this prediction. The project deliverables include:

A detailed report outlining the model-building process.
An explanation of how cross-validation was implemented.
An estimation of the expected out-of-sample error and the rationale behind the choices made during the modeling process.
Finally, the prediction model will be applied to predict outcomes for 20 distinct test cases.
